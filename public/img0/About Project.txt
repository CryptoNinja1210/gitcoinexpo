The logo needs to be positioned in the top left corner of the website, accompanied by the text "GitCoinExpo" in a pixel font. The color scheme for the site should be black and white. All other fonts used should be cohesive and coordinated with each other. Feel free to unleash your creativity and experiment with different font combinations to achieve a harmonious look. Additionally, please incorporate a prominent "BUY TICKET" button. We are currently in the process of developing the sales website, and I will provide you with the ticket sales link as soon as it becomes available.
